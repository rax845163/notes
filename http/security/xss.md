Cross site scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that injects malicious code into a vulnerable web application.
Cross site scripting attacks can be broken down into two types: stored and reflected.
Stored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, is the more damaging of the two. It occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application.
Reflected XSS involves the reflecting of a malicious script off of a web application, onto a userâ€™s browser. The script is embedded into a link, and is only activated once that link is clicked on.
