# Transcation
A transaction generally represents any change in a database. In a Database Management System, a transaction is a single unit of logic or work, sometimes made up of multiple operations. A single transaction consists of one or more independent units of work, each reading and/or writing information to a database or other data store. When this happens it is often important to ensure that all such processing leaves the database or data store in a consistent state. 

# Nested transactions

# Multi-level transactions

# Transactional databases
A transactional database is a DBMS that provides the ACID properties. Transactions also ensure that the effect of concurrent transactions satisfies certain guarantees, known as isolation level.
