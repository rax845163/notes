When the containers have the exact same lifecycle, or when the containers must run on the same node. The most common scenario is that you have a helper process that needs to be located and managed on the same node as the primary container. Another reason to combine containers into a single pod is fro simpler communication between containers in the pod. These containers can communicate through shared volumes (writing to a shared file or directory) and through inter-process communication (semaphores or shared memory).
* Sidecar: 
* Adapter: The adapter pattern is used to standardize and normalize application output or monitoring data for aggregation.
* Ambassador: The ambassador pattern is a useful way to connect containers with the outside world. An ambassador container is essentially a proxy that allows other containers to connect to a port on localhost while the ambassador container can proxy these connections to different environments depending on the cluster's needs.
