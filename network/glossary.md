# RTT (Round Trip delay Time)
Is the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received.

# End-to-end delay
End-to-end delay or one-way delay (OWD) refers to the time taken for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source to destination. Differs from round-trip time (RTT) in that only path in the one direction from source to destination is measured.

# Jitter
Jitter is measuring time difference in packet inter-arrival time.
