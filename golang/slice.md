# Overview

A slice is a data structure describing a contiguous section of an array stored separately from the slice variable itself. A slice is not an array. A slice describes a piece of an array.

What exactly is this slice variable? It's not quite the full story, but for now think of a slice as a little data structure with two elements: a length and a pointer to an element of an array.
